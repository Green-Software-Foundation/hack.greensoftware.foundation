        In 2024, Carbon Hack is about how we measure the environmental impact of
        software.
      </span>
      <span>
        Until now, no single solution has managed to calculate softwareâ€™s
        impacts across all components, across all environments.
      </span>
      <span>
        Impact Framework (IF), an open source project, attempts to do just that,
        be it for carbon emissions, water or land usage, or other chemical
        impacts.
      </span>
      <span>
        For 3 weeks in the early spring, developers and engineers will compete
        to showcase their best application of IF in measuring the ecological
        footprint of software.
